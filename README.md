# Airline-Travel-Call-Centers

**Project Title:** Development of a Generative AI-based Quality Management System (QMS) for Airline Travel Call Centers

**Introduction:**

The objective of this project is to create a web application tailored for airline travel call centers, aiming to enhance quality management through the utilization of Generative AI technologies. The system will analyze call recordings to extract valuable insights, leveraging the Lyzr AI API for its generative capabilities. By transcribing audio files and extracting meaningful data from these transcriptions, the application will facilitate the evaluation of call center operations and agent performance.

**Key Objectives:**

1. **Call Recording Analysis:** Utilize Generative AI to transcribe audio recordings from airline travel call centers accurately.

2. **Insight Extraction:** Extract meaningful insights from transcriptions to assess call center operations and agent performance effectively.

3. **KPI Calculation:** Implement algorithms to calculate various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) crucial for evaluating call quality and overall performance.

4. **User-Friendly Interface:** Design an intuitive web interface for easy navigation and interaction with the system.

**Project Components:**

1. **Audio Transcription Module:** Implement a module to transcribe audio files using the Lyzr AI API, ensuring accurate conversion of speech to text.

2. **Data Analysis Engine:** Develop an engine to process transcribed data, extract relevant information, and calculate KPIs such as Average Handle Time, First Call Resolution, and Customer Satisfaction Score.

3. **User Interface Design:** Design a user-friendly web interface allowing call center managers and supervisors to access and visualize KPI metrics and insights derived from call recordings.

4. **Integration with Lyzr AI API:** Integrate the system with the Lyzr AI API to leverage its generative capabilities for accurate transcription and insightful analysis.

**Expected Outcomes:**

1. Improved Call Quality: By analyzing call recordings and extracting insights, the system will contribute to improving the quality of customer interactions in airline travel call centers.

2. Enhanced Agent Performance: The evaluation of KPIs will enable call center managers to identify areas for improvement and provide targeted training to agents, leading to enhanced overall performance.

3. Efficient Operations: The automation of data analysis processes and KPI calculation will streamline call center operations, allowing for more efficient management and resource allocation.

**Conclusion:**

The development of a Generative AI-based Quality Management System tailored for airline travel call centers represents a significant step towards improving call quality, enhancing agent performance, and optimizing operations. By leveraging advanced technologies and insightful data analysis, the system aims to empower call center managers with the tools and insights necessary to deliver exceptional customer service and drive organizational success.
